                <h2>Message Yourself</h2>
                <p>First, take a moment to check in with yourself. How are you feeling today? What's on your mind? One
                    strategy to help manage your mental health is to write down your thoughts and feelings. This can
                    help you process your emotions and gain a better understanding of your mental state. You can also
                    use this as an opportunity to send yourself a positive message. Talk to yourself as you would talk
                    to a friend. Be encouraging and positive. Remember, it's important
                    to be kind to yourself and practice self-care. You are not alone. We are here to support you.

            <p>If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health
                professional. Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may
                get worse over time and cause serious problems.
            </p>
            <p>These are a sample of 4 kinds of symptoms you may witness within yourself or those around you. They are
                not an exhaustive list and you are encouraged to visit the sites in the external pages section to view a
                wider selection.
